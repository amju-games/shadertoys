Oh no, WebGL crash!
It's not the innards of edge() --  OH, could it be that edge is a reserved word?



Max sprite size = 31 bits wide

Should use 8x8 cells of pixels? - no, 1 column of 31-bit "bytes"

Get pixel at (x, y) for frame, spriteID
Want mirrored sprites for 2 directions
Look left and right - randomly change top half of sprite?

Sprite data: rows of 8-bit bytes, number of columns in each row is fixed for that sprite.

Also need mask data?

Arches: these must be done as 2 separate sprites, right? Painters algo won't work here!

Need to draw sprites in z order, right?

Factor out head sprite, also allows for head turning


Enter a room: set size, which depends on vertical 'column' background sprites and extra wall sprites.
When we enter room, hide wall sprites from previous room, and show new sprites for this room.

Walk speed & anims: vary these, so wulf walks, stops, then continues.

Change direction: mirror arch & wulf sprites (and walls?)
Only one arch on screen at once? We possibly change dir after arch has gone off screen.

Data:
Need 2 intermediate frames from walk cycle.
Head turn
Need wall columns, (+function to stack them).
